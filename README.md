🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Automation with GitHub Actions
📌 Task 1: Automate Code Deployment Using CI/CD Pipeline
This repository demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a Node.js web app using GitHub Actions and DockerHub.

-----------------------------------------

🎯 Objective
Automate the process of:

1.Running tests
2.Building the app
3.Creating a Docker image
4.Pushing the image to DockerHub
5.(Optional) Deploying it to a hosting platform (e.g., a server or cloud service)


🧰 Tools & Technologies
-GitHub & GitHub Actions – CI/CD workflow orchestration

-Node.js – Sample web application

-Docker & DockerHub – Containerization and image registry
---------------------------------------

⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflow
The CI/CD workflow is defined in:
.github/workflows/main.yml

✅ Workflow Triggers
Runs on every push to the main branch

🛠️ Jobs Included
1.Build
   Set up Node.js
   Install dependencies
   Run tests

2.Dockerize
   Build Docker image
   Push image to DockerHub
---------------------------------------------

🐳 DockerHub Integration
To enable DockerHub image pushes:

1.Create secrets in your GitHub repo:

    DOCKER_USERNAME
    DOCKER_PASSWORD

2.Docker image will be tagged and pushed as:
    docker.io/<your-username>/<your-repo>:latest

📦 Sample Node.js App
The app is a minimal Express.js server located in the app/ directory. You can replace it with your own code if needed.

🚀 Getting Started
Fork this repo or clone it.

Add your DockerHub credentials as secrets.

Push code to main.

GitHub Actions will trigger the pipeline automatically.
